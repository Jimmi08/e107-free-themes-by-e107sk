## InfadeBlack Theme

Last check: 09/2019

Originally BLACKv2 theme made by infade.net in 2006 (yes, it's no mistaken). I needed to test no bootstrap theme, so I decided to use this theme. I changed the theme name to InfadeBlack on the honour of the original author.

## Call of Duty: Ghosts theme

I found some version of this theme during cleaning my comp. I don't think it was original 0.6 version, maybe some attempt to fix if for Alpha version. If I am not mistaken, it was downloaded from e107hungary site. So I prepared it for version 2.3 (2.2.2git). 
It's not boostrap theme, so it's not responsive.
